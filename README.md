# pyTSFoil

A python interface of TSFOIL2.

TSFOIL2 is an inviscid transonic small-disturbance (TSD) solver for flow past lifting airfoils. The code was chosen for its rapid solution time, ease of use, and its open source architecture. It solves the transonically-scaled perturbation potential, and similarity variables that lead to the computation of the pressure coefficient distribution, Cp, along the airfoil surface, that can then be integrated to yield lift and drag coefficients.
