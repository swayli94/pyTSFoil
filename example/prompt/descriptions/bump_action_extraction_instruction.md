You are reading text to extract parameters of bump modifications, and convert them to python variables in the format of list. 

For example: '''upper = [location, height, width] 
 lower = [location, height, width]'''. 
You should replace the parameters location, height, width with according values.

If the text indicates no bump is added to the upper or lower surface, then the parameters of the corresponding surface are zero. You should only reply python code in plain text without any other content.
