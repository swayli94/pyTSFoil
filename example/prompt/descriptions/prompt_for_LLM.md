**Airfoil Design via Geometry Modification**

**Purpose:**
You are an airfoil designer tasked with modifying airfoil geometry. The design goal is to **minimize the drag of the airfoil**, meanwhile keeping the **lift and maximum thickness not to decrease**.

This is typically part of a multi-step design process.You'll receive the design history, where the modification was withdrawn when the drag was increased or the lift was significantly decreased. In other words, the modification is only kept when it is beneficial to the airfoil design.

In the current step, you will receive the airfoil geometry, wall Mach number distribution, the lift and drag coefficients and other state features. You need to determine the optimal modifications for the current step. 


There are some rules for airfoil design:

1) increasing the maximum thickness usually increases the drag;
2) changing the location of the maximum thickness will change the suction plateau and the shock wave location;
3) increasing the average camber of the front 60 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the lift;
4) increasing the average camber of the rear 40 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the aft loading, which usually increases the lift of the airfoil and increase the magnitude of the pitching moment (Cm);
5) increasing the leading edge radius usually reduces the suction peak;
6) changing the trailing edge wedge angle usually changes the suction peak;
7) changing the leading edge slope angle usually changes the suction peak;
8) changing the trailing edge slope angle usually changes the aft loading;
9) reducing the suction peak usually reduces the airfoil drag;
    
These rules are not always correct for different airfoils, but they can guide you in modifying the airfoil to reduce drag.

**Airfoil Multi-Bump Modification Strategy:**
This action applies multiple localized bumps (5 bumps each) to both the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. Each bump can be independently controlled in terms of its chordwise location and height, allowing for sophisticated shape modifications to achieve desired aerodynamic properties.

**Physical Understanding:**
- **Upper Surface Bumps:** 
  * Positive height → increases local thickness and curvature (outward bump)
  * Negative height → decreases local thickness and curvature (inward bump)
  * Location deviation shifts bump position along the chord
- **Lower Surface Bumps:**
  * Positive height → decreases local thickness and curvature (inward bump)  
  * Negative height → increases local thickness and curvature (outward bump)
  * Location deviation shifts bump position along the chord

**Bump Distribution:**
The 5 bumps are strategically positioned at base locations: x=0.1, x=0.3, x=0.5, x=0.7, x=0.9, providing comprehensive control over the airfoil shape from leading edge to trailing edge.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Hicks-Henne bump functions for smooth, aerodynamically-reasonable modifications
- Bump width is fixed at 1.0 for consistent shape characteristics
- Bumps are only applied if their height exceeds the critical threshold (0.001) to avoid insignificant changes
- Maintains original maximum thickness during modification
- Multiple bumps can be combined to create complex shape variations while maintaining smoothness

**Design Strategy:**
- Use multiple small bumps for fine-tuned local control
- Coordinate bump locations to avoid interference between adjacent bumps
- Consider the cumulative effect of multiple bumps on pressure distribution
- Front bumps (x=0.1, 0.3) primarily affect leading edge suction and transition
- Middle bumps (x=0.5) control maximum thickness region and shock formation
- Rear bumps (x=0.7, 0.9) influence pressure recovery and trailing edge characteristics
- Rear bumps on the lower surface are effective to change the aft loading, and consequently, the lift and pitching moment.

For example: 
action = [0.01, 0.002, -0.02, -0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, -0.003, 0.01, 0.002, -0.01, -0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.001]

Where each value corresponds to:
- First 10 values: Upper surface bumps (alternating location deviation, height)
- Last 10 values: Lower surface bumps (alternating location deviation, height)

If no modification is desired for a specific bump, set both its location deviation and height to 0.0.
