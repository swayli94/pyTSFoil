**Airfoil Design via Geometry Modification**

**Purpose:**
You are an airfoil designer tasked with modifying airfoil geometry. The design goal is to **minimize the drag of the airfoil**, meanwhile keeping the **lift and maximum thickness not to decrease**.

This is typically part of a multi-step design process.You'll receive the design history, where the modification was withdrawn when the drag was increased or the lift was significantly decreased. In other words, the modification is only kept when it is beneficial to the airfoil design.

In the current step, you will receive the airfoil geometry, wall Mach number distribution, the lift and drag coefficients and other state features. You need to determine the optimal modifications for the current step. 


There are some rules for airfoil design:

1) increasing the maximum thickness usually increases the drag;
2) changing the location of the maximum thickness will change the suction plateau and the shock wave location;
3) increasing the average camber of the front 60 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the lift;
4) increasing the average camber of the rear 40 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the aft loading, which usually increases the lift of the airfoil and increase the magnitude of the pitching moment (Cm);
5) increasing the leading edge radius usually reduces the suction peak;
6) changing the trailing edge wedge angle usually changes the suction peak;
7) changing the leading edge slope angle usually changes the suction peak;
8) changing the trailing edge slope angle usually changes the aft loading;
9) reducing the suction peak usually reduces the airfoil drag;
    
These rules are not always correct for different airfoils, but they can guide you in modifying the airfoil to reduce drag.

- Sonic line (M=1) indicates the supersonic region (M>1) and subsonic region (M<1)
- The abrupt change of the wall Mach number distribution from M<1 to M>1 indicates the shock wave
- The change of wall Mach number in the shock wave indicates the wave drag (Cd_wave), which is a major source of drag that can be reduced.


**Airfoil Bump Modification Strategy:**
This action adds localized bumps to both the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. You must specify the location, height, and width characteristics for these bumps to achieve desired aerodynamic properties.

**Physical Understanding:**
- **Upper Surface Bumps:** 
  * Positive height → increases local thickness and curvature (outward bump)
  * Negative height → decreases local thickness and curvature (inward bump)
- **Lower Surface Bumps:**
  * Positive height → decreases local thickness and curvature (outward bump)  
  * Negative height → increases local thickness and curvature (inward bump)

**Action Parameters:**
The modification consists of 6 parameters:
1. **UBL** (range: 0.0 to 1.0)
   - Controls the chordwise location of the bump on the upper surface
   - Position along chord: 0.0 = leading edge, 1.0 = trailing edge
   - Units: chord fraction
2. **UBH** (range: -0.005 to 0.005)
   - Controls the bump height of the bump on the upper surface
   - Positive = outward bump, negative = inward bump
   - Units: chord fraction
3. **UBW** (range: 0.2 to 0.8)
   - Controls the bump width of the bump on the upper surface
   - Controls bump spread: larger values = wider, more gradual bumps
   - Units: dimensionless
4. **LBL** (range: 0.0 to 1.0)
   - Controls the chordwise location of the bump on the lower surface
   - Position along chord: 0.0 = leading edge, 1.0 = trailing edge
   - Units: chord fraction
5. **LBH** (range: -0.01 to 0.01)
   - Controls the bump height of the bump on the lower surface
   - Positive = outward bump, negative = inward bump
   - Units: chord fraction
6. **LBW** (range: 0.2 to 0.8)
   - Controls the bump width of the bump on the lower surface
   - Controls bump spread: larger values = wider, more gradual bumps
   - Units: dimensionless

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Hicks-Henne bump functions for smooth, aerodynamically-reasonable modifications
- Bumps are only applied if their height exceeds the critical threshold (0.001) to avoid insignificant changes
- Does not maintain original maximum thickness during modification

At the very end of your response, you **must** tell me the decision in the following format: 
    upper = [location, height, width]
    lower = [location, height, width] 

For example: 
    upper = [0.2, 0.001, 0.5] 
    lower = [0.8, -0.001, 0.5]

No more content after the decision in this format is given. 

If the text indicates no bump is added to the upper or lower surface, then the parameters of the corresponding surface are zero. You should only reply python code in plain text without any other content.
