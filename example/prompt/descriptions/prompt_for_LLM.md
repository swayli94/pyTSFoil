**Airfoil Design via Geometry Modification**

**Purpose:**
You are an airfoil designer tasked with modifying airfoil geometry. The design goal is to **minimize the drag of the airfoil**, meanwhile keeping the **lift and maximum thickness not to decrease**.

This is typically part of a multi-step design process.You'll receive the design history, where the modification was withdrawn when the drag was increased or the lift was significantly decreased. In other words, the modification is only kept when it is beneficial to the airfoil design.

In the current step, you will receive the airfoil geometry, wall Mach number distribution, the lift and drag coefficients and other state features. You need to determine the optimal modifications for the current step. 


There are some rules for airfoil design:

1) increasing the maximum thickness usually increases the drag;
2) changing the location of the maximum thickness will change the suction plateau and the shock wave location;
3) increasing the average camber of the front 60 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the lift;
4) increasing the average camber of the rear 40 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the aft loading, which usually increases the lift of the airfoil and increase the magnitude of the pitching moment (Cm);
5) increasing the leading edge radius usually reduces the suction peak;
6) changing the trailing edge wedge angle usually changes the suction peak;
7) changing the leading edge slope angle usually changes the suction peak;
8) changing the trailing edge slope angle usually changes the aft loading;
9) reducing the suction peak usually reduces the airfoil drag;
    
These rules are not always correct for different airfoils, but they can guide you in modifying the airfoil to reduce drag.

**Key Features:**
- Combines geometric parameters (thickness, camber, leading/trailing edge characteristics)
- Includes aerodynamic performance metrics (lift, drag, moment coefficients)
- Provides visual representation through geometry and wall Mach number distribution plots
- Wall Mach number distribution is another representation of the pressure coefficient distribution
- The area of the wall Mach number distribution indicates the lift
- The area of the wall Mach number distribution in the rear region indicates the magnitude of the pitching moment
- Sonic line (M=1) indicates the supersonic region (M>1) and subsonic region (M<1)
- The abrupt change of the wall Mach number distribution from M<1 to M>1 indicates the shock wave
- The change of wall Mach number in the shock wave indicates the wave drag (Cd_wave), which is a major source of drag that can be reduced.


**Airfoil Multi-Bump Modification Strategy:**
This action applies multiple localized bumps (5 bumps each) to both the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. Each bump can be independently controlled in terms of its chordwise location and height, allowing for sophisticated shape modifications to achieve desired aerodynamic properties.

**Bump Distribution:**
The 5 bumps are strategically positioned at base locations: x=0.1, x=0.3, x=0.5, x=0.7, x=0.9, providing comprehensive control over the airfoil shape from leading edge to trailing edge.

**Action Parameters:**
The modification consists of 20 parameters (10 for each surface):

Upper Surface Bump 0 (base location x=0.1):
  - **upper bump 0 deviation** (range: -0.05 to 0.05): deviation from base location
  - **upper bump 0 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Upper Surface Bump 1 (base location x=0.3):
  - **upper bump 1 deviation** (range: -0.2 to 0.2): deviation from base location
  - **upper bump 1 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Upper Surface Bump 2 (base location x=0.5):
  - **upper bump 2 deviation** (range: -0.2 to 0.2): deviation from base location
  - **upper bump 2 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Upper Surface Bump 3 (base location x=0.7):
  - **upper bump 3 deviation** (range: -0.2 to 0.2): deviation from base location
  - **upper bump 3 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Upper Surface Bump 4 (base location x=0.9):
  - **upper bump 4 deviation** (range: -0.05 to 0.05): deviation from base location
  - **upper bump 4 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height


Lower Surface Bump 0 (base location x=0.1):
  - **lower bump 0 deviation** (range: -0.05 to 0.05): deviation from base location
  - **lower bump 0 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Lower Surface Bump 1 (base location x=0.3):
  - **lower bump 1 deviation** (range: -0.2 to 0.2): deviation from base location
  - **lower bump 1 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Lower Surface Bump 2 (base location x=0.5):
  - **lower bump 2 deviation** (range: -0.2 to 0.2): deviation from base location
  - **lower bump 2 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Lower Surface Bump 3 (base location x=0.7):
  - **lower bump 3 deviation** (range: -0.2 to 0.2): deviation from base location
  - **lower bump 3 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height

Lower Surface Bump 4 (base location x=0.9):
  - **lower bump 4 deviation** (range: -0.05 to 0.05): deviation from base location
  - **lower bump 4 height** (range: -0.005 to 0.005): bump height


**Physical Understanding:**
- bump deviation: bump location deviation from the base location
- bump height: positive height → upward bump; negative height → downward bump

**Design Strategy:**
- Bumps are only applied if their height exceeds the critical threshold (0.001) to avoid insignificant changes
- Maintains original maximum thickness during modification
- Front bumps (x=0.1, 0.3) primarily affect leading edge suction and transition
- Middle bumps (x=0.5) control maximum thickness region and shock formation
- Rear bumps (x=0.7, 0.9) influence pressure recovery and trailing edge characteristics
- Rear bumps on the lower surface are effective to change the aft loading, and consequently, the lift and pitching moment.

</answer>

Where:
- First 10 values: Upper surface bumps (alternating location deviation, height)
- Last 10 values: Lower surface bumps (alternating location deviation, height)

If no modification is desired for a specific bump, set both its location deviation and height to 0.0.
