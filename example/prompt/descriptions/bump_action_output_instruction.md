At the very end of your response, you **must** tell me the decision in the following format: 
    upper = [location, height, width]
    lower = [location, height, width] 

For example: 
    upper = [0.2, 0.001, 0.5] 
    lower = [0.8, -0.001, 0.5]

No more content after the decision in this format is given. 

If the text indicates no bump is added to the upper or lower surface, then the parameters of the corresponding surface are zero. You should only reply python code in plain text without any other content.
