At the very end of your response, you **must** tell me the decision in the following format: 
action = [U0L, U0H, U1L, U1H, U2L, U2H, U3L, U3H, U4L, U4H, L0L, L0H, L1L, L1H, L2L, L2H, L3L, L3H, L4L, L4H]

For example: 
action = [0.01, 0.002, -0.02, -0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, -0.003, 0.01, 0.002, -0.01, -0.001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.001]

Where each value corresponds to:
- First 10 values: Upper surface bumps (alternating location deviation, height)
- Last 10 values: Lower surface bumps (alternating location deviation, height)

If no modification is desired for a specific bump, set both its location deviation and height to 0.0.

No more content after the decision in this format is given.
