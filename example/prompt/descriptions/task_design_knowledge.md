There are some rules for airfoil design:

1) increasing the maximum thickness usually increases the drag;
2) changing the location of the maximum thickness will change the suction plateau and the shock wave location;
3) increasing the average camber of the front 60 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the lift;
4) increasing the average camber of the rear 40 percentage of the airfoil usually increases the aft loading, which usually increases the lift of the airfoil and increase the magnitude of the pitching moment (Cm);
5) increasing the leading edge radius usually reduces the suction peak;
6) changing the trailing edge wedge angle usually changes the suction peak;
7) changing the leading edge slope angle usually changes the suction peak;
8) changing the trailing edge slope angle usually changes the aft loading;
9) reducing the suction peak usually reduces the airfoil drag;
    
These rules are not always correct for different airfoils, but they can guide you in modifying the airfoil to reduce drag.
