**Airfoil Multi-Bump Modification Strategy:**
This action applies multiple localized bumps (5 bumps each) to both the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. Each bump can be independently controlled in terms of its chordwise location and height, allowing for sophisticated shape modifications to achieve desired aerodynamic properties.

**Physical Understanding:**
- **Upper Surface Bumps:** 
  * Positive height → increases local thickness and curvature (outward bump)
  * Negative height → decreases local thickness and curvature (inward bump)
  * Location deviation shifts bump position along the chord
- **Lower Surface Bumps:**
  * Positive height → decreases local thickness and curvature (inward bump)  
  * Negative height → increases local thickness and curvature (outward bump)
  * Location deviation shifts bump position along the chord

**Bump Distribution:**
The 5 bumps are strategically positioned at base locations: x=0.1, x=0.3, x=0.5, x=0.7, x=0.9, providing comprehensive control over the airfoil shape from leading edge to trailing edge.

**Action Parameters:**
The modification consists of 20 parameters (10 for each surface):

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Hicks-Henne bump functions for smooth, aerodynamically-reasonable modifications
- Bump width is fixed at 1.0 for consistent shape characteristics
- Bumps are only applied if their height exceeds the critical threshold (0.001) to avoid insignificant changes
- Maintains original maximum thickness during modification
- Multiple bumps can be combined to create complex shape variations while maintaining smoothness

**Design Strategy:**
- Use multiple small bumps for fine-tuned local control
- Coordinate bump locations to avoid interference between adjacent bumps
- Consider the cumulative effect of multiple bumps on pressure distribution
- Front bumps (x=0.1, 0.3) primarily affect leading edge suction and transition
- Middle bumps (x=0.5) control maximum thickness region and shock formation
- Rear bumps (x=0.7, 0.9) influence pressure recovery and trailing edge characteristics
- Rear bumps on the lower surface are effective to change the aft loading, and consequently, the lift and pitching moment.
