**Airfoil Design via Geometry Modification**

**Purpose:**
You are an airfoil designer tasked with modifying airfoil geometry. The design goal is to **minimize the drag of the airfoil**, meanwhile keeping the **lift and maximum thickness not to decrease**.

This is typically part of a multi-step design process.You'll receive the design history, where the modification was withdrawn when the drag was increased or the lift was significantly decreased. In other words, the modification is only kept when it is beneficial to the airfoil design.

In the current step, you will receive the airfoil geometry, wall Mach number distribution, the lift and drag coefficients and other state features. You need to determine the optimal modifications for the current step.
